# Malware Analysis in Python
This is a python program I am developing to allow easy analysis of malware.
Future iterations of this program will include a Flask web server displaying information obtained from the scans. 


## TODO
- [ ] Finish registry baselineing (Check more than just startup)                - In work
- [X] Network baseline
    - Is there a faster way other than using sockets to check all 65535 ports?
- [ ] Intergrate Flask web framework                                            - In work
- [ ] Docker / cloud intergration
- [ ] Fix the way it gets strings of the binary
- [ ] Check for packed binary

# Usage
For flask setup in powershell:
```powershell
$env:FLASK_APP = ".\webserver.py"
$env:FLASK_ENV=development
```
