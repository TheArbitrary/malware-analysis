# Malware Analysis in Python
This is a python program I am developing to allow easy analysis of malware.
Future iterations of this program will include a Flask web server displaying information obtained from the scans. 


## TODO
- [ ] Finish registry baselineing (Check more than just startup)
- [ ] Network baseline
    - Is there a faster way other than using sockets to check all 65535 ports?
- [ ] Intergrate Flask web framework
- [ ] Docker / cloud intergration
